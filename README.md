# 🧿 Delta Sigma Phi AR Recruitment Experience

> A WebAR experience designed to amplify recruitment efforts for **Delta Sigma Phi** using browser-based augmented reality.

## 📌 Overview

This project was an **interactive AR tabling tool** built with [8th Wall](https://www.8thwall.com/), allowing students to scan a QR code and explore Delta Sigma Phi’s identity through their phones by just scanning a QR code (no app required)

### ⚙️ How it Worked

When launched, the WebAR experience presented:

- 🛡️ **3D Fraternity Crest**: Centered in space and clickable, linking to the official Delta Sigma Fi website  
- 👥 **Leadership Panel**: Angled to the right, showcasing chapter leaders with tappable photos linking to their individual Instagram profiles  
- 📱 **Instagram Highlights Panel**: Angled to the left, featuring popular Delta Sigma Fi posts, each linked directly to Instagram

All interactions were live links, embedded in 3D space, for an engaging, mobile-native outreach tool.

## 🎯 Purpose

This experience was created to **boost recruitment efforts** by turning a standard tabling booth into a tech-forward, immersive moment. The goals:

- Increase booth engagement through novelty and AR magic  
- Allow potential recruits to explore the frat on their own terms  
- Reflect Delta Sigma Fi’s modern, connected brand

## 💀 Project Status

**Retired.**  
8th Wall's free tier allows only 3 active projects, so this experience was sunset to make space for ongoing work.
